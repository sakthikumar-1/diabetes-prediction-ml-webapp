## 📌 Overview

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that requires early identification for effective management. This system leverages supervised Machine Learning algorithms trained on the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset to classify whether a patient is at risk of diabetes based on key health indicators.

The application supports both quick prediction and detailed prediction modes, enabling flexible user interaction and improved usability.
